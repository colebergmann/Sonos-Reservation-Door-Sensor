# Sonos-Reservation-Door-Sensor
This project was created to watch a door sensor with a Raspberry Pi, and automatically trigger Sonos speakers to play music when an AirBnB guest checks in for the first time.

This requires a normally open hardwired door sensor (on GPIO pin X). Or fork this project to add support for 433MHz wireless tx/rx.
